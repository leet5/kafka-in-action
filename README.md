# Kafka In Action

In this project, I tried to consider the various features of the **[Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/)** platform and apply them in action.
I used Confluent implementation of Kafka with their Control-Center in Docker. 

So, there are such essential parts as:
* Topics
* Partitions and replicas
* Kafka Brokers
* Producers and Consumers
* Schema Registry
* Etc.

All features were covered while reading [Kafka In Action](https://www.manning.com/books/kafka-in-action) book
